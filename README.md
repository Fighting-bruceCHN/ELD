## Credits


This project makes use of the methods described in the paper [Object Landmark Discovery Through Unsupervised Adaptation](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9505-object-landmark-discovery-through-unsupervised-adaptation.pdf) by Enrique Sanchez and Georgios Tzimiropoulos, as presented at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in 2019.


A portion of our implementation is based on the code found in the following GitHub repository: [SAIC-Unsupervised-landmark-detection-NeurIPS2019](https://github.com/ESanchezLozano/SAIC-Unsupervised-landmark-detection-NeurIPS2019).


We would like to express our gratitude to the authors for their valuable work and for making their code available for the community.
